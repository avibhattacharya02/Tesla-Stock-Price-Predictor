Tesla Stock Price Analysis

This project involves analyzing Tesla's stock prices using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to better understand the trends and behaviors of Tesla's stock over time.

Introduction

The goal of this project is to delve into Tesla's stock prices and uncover trends and patterns. We will use various Python libraries to manipulate the data, create visualizations, and perform some machine learning tasks.

Data

The dataset used in this project is TeslaStockPrice.csv, which includes the following columns:

Date: The date of the stock price record.
Open: The opening price of the stock.
High: The highest price of the stock during the day.
Low: The lowest price of the stock during the day.
Close: The closing price of the stock.
Volume: The volume of shares traded.

Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

tesla_stock_analysis.py: The main script for performing the data analysis and generating visualizations.
TeslaStockPrice.csv: The dataset with Tesla's stock prices.
Visualizations

The script will create several visualizations to help understand the data, including:

A line plot of the closing prices over time.
Distribution plots for the Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume columns.
Box plots for the Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume columns.
Bar plots showing the average Open, High, Low, and Close prices by year.
